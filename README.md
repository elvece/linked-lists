## Linked Lists

**This repo contains my work for the following exercise challenge:***

### Objectives

* Explain what a linked list is, and describe 3 types of linked lists
* Be comfortable implementing a basic linked list

#### What is a linked list?

In it's simplest form, a singly linked list, it's an ordered list of nodes. The linked list itself will contain a pointer to the HEAD node and usually some other properties, like the length of the list. Every node element contains a pointer to the data contained at that node, and a pointer to the next element in the linked list. The last element in the list will have a null reference for it's 'next' value.

_A singly linked list whose nodes contain two fields: an integer value and a link to the next node_

#### Exercise

Implement `add` and `remove` functions to the stubbed out linked_list implementation here: https://github.com/gSchool/linked_list_practice

The tests are written for you already, you just need to make them all pass.

#### Doubly Linked Lists

A doubly linked list contains node which contain both a `next` and a `prev` value. This can be useful when you need to easily traverse both directions along the list, instead of solely moving forward.

#### Circular Linked Lists

A circular linked list is a list in which the tail element's `next` property is pointing to the `head` of the linked list.

### Exercise

Add add/remove functionality to CircularLinkedLists and DoublyLinkedLists, there are stubs already there. Uncomment the specs, and make them pass!

_Bonus_: Add Sentinel nodes. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_node)

_Bonus Bonus_: Add the ability to insert or delete nodes at arbitrary points in the list, instead of just at the end.
